### Brief information about yourself
My professional activity has never been associated with website development, writing code, scripts, etc. A friendly environment, mainly programmers and administrators, constantly pushed to study this area of knowledge. Having reached the professional and career limit in my field, I realized that I needed to move on. Well, or at least try yourself in another area.
Friends advised me to take a course at RS School, which will allow me to understand my capabilities and desires.

I have always been drawn to computer technology. My desire for a deep understanding of the principles of operation of a technical device or software helped a lot at the start.
I feel closer to studying Backend Development. A truly amazing feeling when lines of code turn into a working website.

I believe that my desire to learn and my desire for new knowledge will help me to go through this difficult but exciting path to my goal.
